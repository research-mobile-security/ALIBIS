## 1. Introduction

The **CodePurpose service** is part of the **MetaLeak-LLM-based** system architecture.

This service is used to determine the purpose of EXIF-related codebooks, including:

- How do code blocks handle EXIF metadata? Retain EXIF metadata in images or remove it?
- If the code block retains EXIF metadata, what types of metadata does the code block retain among the five types of **datetime, GPS, model, brand, and software**?

This service is applicable to **Group-1** and **Group-2**.
